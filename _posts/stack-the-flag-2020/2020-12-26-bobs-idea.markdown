This is the first challenge from the Cryptography section of Stack-The-Flag 2020 by csg-govtech.

## Statement

>Bob wants Alice to help him design the stream cipher’s keystream generator based on his rough idea. Can COViD steal Bob’s “protected” idea?

The challenge is attached with a pcapng file (which can be open with [WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/))

## Observation

I found out the following texts by analyzing the packages.

```
p = 298161833288328455288826827978944092433
g = 216590906870332474191827756801961881648
g^a = 181553548982634226931709548695881171814
g^b = 64889049934231151703132324484506000958
```
>Hi Alice, could you please help me to design a keystream generator according to the file I share in the file server so that I can use it to encrypt my 500-bytes secret message? Please make sure it run with maximum period without repeating the keystream. The password to protect the file is our shared Diffie-Hellman key in digits. Thanks.

![Package length of No. 107 and 109 is exceptionally big](/images/stack-the-flag-2020/bobs_1.png)

Besides the texts, there are also 2 packages that are exceptionally big compare to others. This indicate that maybe some kind of file had sent through the network.

## Solution

First of all, I extract out the 2 large data from WireShark run `file` command on  it.

```shell
$ file file_1.bin
file_1.bin: Zip archive data, at least v5.1 to extract
$ file file_2.bin
file_2.bin: data
```

It tells that `file_1.bin` is a zip file and `file_2.bin` is just some random data.

This suggests that the file sent by Bob might be the combination of `file_1.bin` and `file_2.bin` as it was splitted during the process of transfering the file.

So now I combine two of the file together.

```shell
$ cat file_1.bin file_2.bin > file.zip
```

I open it using 7zip and it then requests for a password.

From the text sent by Bob. He told Alice that the password of the file is Diffie-Hellman key in digits.

So this explains why `p, g, g^a, g^b` are sent in the network.

Diffie-Hellman depends on the hardness of computing discrete logarithm problem. However, in this case Bob's `p` seems to be small enough to find `a` and `b`.

So what I did was just throw it into python code and let it do the work.

```python
from sympy.ntheory.residue_ntheory import discrete_log

g = 216590906870332474191827756801961881648
p = 298161833288328455288826827978944092433
A = 181553548982634226931709548695881171814
B = 64889049934231151703132324484506000958

a = discrete_log(p,A,g)

assert pow(g,a,p) == A

print(pow(B,a,p))
```

And it works! (took around 30 sec)

From the tips given by the admin on discord, the flag format is in `csg-govtech{shared_secret}`

I got stuck around here for like an hour because I didn't know what the question wants LOL. Thank god my teammate @mimomomi saw the tips and told me about it.
